# How to run the tests?

First, confirm that the postgres database is running (Django tests create a tmp database). In a local environment,
you can use Docker compose in the root
directory of the project:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Use pytest to run the tests in this directory

```
pytest -v
```

Pytest works with the Django test framework using the `pytest-django` plugin. Make sure you have it installed in your environment.
It is configured in the `pyproject.toml` file of the project:
```
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "swf_fastmon_agent.database.settings"
```
